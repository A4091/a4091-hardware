Changes which went into the Rev 4 board.

 1. Relocate cap C12 away from ROM to make it easier to insert/remove ROM
 2. Move C300A and C10 further away from the SCSI chip for easier hand-soldering
 3. Rotate C351A so all large caps have the same alignment
 4. Add GND vias at the two large mount holes for the external SCSI connector
 5. Change spacing of Zorro connector fingers (were very slightly too wide)
 6. Correct very minor alignment issue of GAL pads
 7. Correct minor alignment issue of some bottom side SMD components
 8. Add 12/5V Berg-style floppy power connector option
 9. Add 12V fan power connector option
