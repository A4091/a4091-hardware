Changes which went into the Rev 3 board.

 1. Move mouse bite tabs of terminator board to the bottom so that the cut
    off tabs will be hidden under the SCSI connector.
 2. Rev2 boards produced by PCBWay were missing R121 and FB500 silk of value.
    This does not appear to be a problem with Gerbers.
 3. Flip silkscreen part numbers on top side to match part markings
 4. Rename PLD_MASTER net to MASTER
 5. Update silkscreen for Rev 3
 6. Remove solder mask from gold fingers area
 7. Solder stencil should place more solder on GAL and capacitor pads
 8. Retract the 5V power plane layer from the drive mount area so it could be
    safe to drill new mounts.
 9. Expose copper text of Haynie quote so that it will be coated with ENIG.
10. Move Haynie quote left so that it can be completely covered by bracket.
11. Stencil should place less solder on QFP160 pads (retract paste mask).
12. Increase termination power trace width from 0.8mm to 1mm
13. Increase pin socket hole size for U301 clock crystal
14. Add optional C306B 10pF cap on Z_DTACK
