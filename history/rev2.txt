A number of minor changes went into the Rev 2 board.

 1. Increase trace width of 5V to SCSI Term power diode. Make full path 0.8mm
 2. Increase SCSI Term power via size
 3. Update silkscreen of all ferrite beads to be 60 Ohm
 4. Clean up / enlarge silkscreen of all bottom side part values
 5. Make sure all ICs have pin 1 dots visible after component is soldered down
 6. Change all ferrite beads to 60 Ohm @ 100 MHz
 7. Decrease Zorro edge connector size by 0.2mm at each end.
    Decrease edge connector size by 0.1mm at each end
 8. Increase board length by 0.3mm at GAL side of board
 9. Make Polyfuse silkscreen closer to original
10. Minor cleanup of schematic traces to more closely match original board.
11. Add Dave Haynie quote to copper layer of bottom side
12. Relabel Zorro Pin 17 and net to Z_CINH (for Zorro III).
13. Tweak A4091 ROM socket holes slightly to handle ZIF EEPROM socket
14. Make holes larger for crystal oscillator
15. Decrease board length by 0.2mm at external SCSI connector side of board
16. Reduce attachment points for SCSI terminator from 4 to 2
17. Make C300E 100nF  (113.124 83.149)
18. Make C300B 10nF   (125.700 83.150)
19. Make C300H 10nF   (130.2 64.3)
