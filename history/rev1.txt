Rev 1 of the board was completed on November 20, 2021

It was based on two original Commodore A4091 Rev B boards which were
produced by DKB during and after Commodore's bankruptcy in 1994.

Since there were no publicly-available schematics for the board, we
reverse-engineered the schematics by studying high resolution board
photos and by using a meter to locate every trace. This was a very
time-consuming process. Luckily with two people working on it together,
one doing the tracing and one capturing the schematics, the teamwork
paid off.

The first Rev 1 board was fully assembled by December 2, 2021.

This revision of the board works and is stable. Since we only made
five of this board, there are only two people outside of Stefan and
Chris who own one.
